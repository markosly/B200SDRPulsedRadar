# B200SDRPulsedRadar
This project implements a function pulsed radar system using an Ettus Research B200 Mini  and the UHD.


The file named RunTestBSeries calls the executible with the appropriate arguments.

The project also relies on easyBMP, which is available online.

The GUI is implemented as a simple webpage (index.html), which calls various php scripts to grab relevant data from the radar application.
